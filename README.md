# Downloading-from-maktabkhooneh

We can get the video download link list from the maktabkhooneh courses and download them and then rename the video files in order

1 --> First you should get the url like the example below and then put it in the links.txt file.

      https://maktabkhooneh.org/course/64/64-%D8%AC%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D8%AE%D8%B7%DB%8C/

2 --> Then you can run the maktabkhooneh.py file so it will scrap the website and then it will get your links.

3 --> All of those download links are going to be in the hrefs.txt for each session of that course that you have been chosen. Now you can download them with softwares like IDM or others.

4 --> After downloading them you can see that your file names are ugly a little bit! Now we must name them in some order (like : 1.mp4 and 2.mp4 and 3.mp4). To do that you need to open the downloadedLink.txt file and add the path of all of those files that you have downloaded.

5 --> Then run the namingFile.py and it will rename them all and you can watch the course easily. 

NOTE : you must clear all txt files before using it again
